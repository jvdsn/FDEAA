        <h:p>
		The purpose of the first set of Collaborative Protection Profiles (cPPs) for Full Drive Encryption (FDE): Authorization Acquisition (AA) and Encryption Engine (EE) is to provide requirements for Data-at-Rest protection for a lost device that contains storage. These cPPs allow FDE solutions based in software and/or hardware to meet the requirements. The form factor for a storage device may vary, but could include: system hard drives/solid state drives in servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, tablets, and external media. A hardware solution could be a Self-Encrypting Drive or other hardware-based solutions; the interface (USB, SATA, etc.) used to connect the storage device to the host machine is outside the scope of this cPP.
        </h:p><h:p>
        Full Drive Encryption encrypts all data (with certain exceptions) on the storage device and permits access to the data only after successful authorization to the FDE solution. The exceptions include the necessity to leave a portion of the storage device (the size may vary based on implementation) unencrypted for such things as the Master Boot Record (MBR) or other AA/EE pre-authentication software. These FDE cPPs interpret the term “full drive encryption” to allow FDE solutions to leave a portion of the storage device unencrypted so long as it contains plaintext user or plaintext authorization data.
        </h:p><h:p>
        Since the FDE cPPs support a variety of solutions, two cPPs describe the requirements for the FDE components shown in Figure 1.  
        </h:p>
        
        <h:p><figure entity="images/fde-components.png" title="FDE Components" id="toe"/></h:p>

        <h:p>The FDE cPP - Authorization Acquisition describes the requirements for the Authorization Acquisition piece and details the security requirements and assurance activities necessary to interact with a user and result in the availability of sending a Border Encryption Value (BEV) to the Encryption Engine.</h:p>
        <h:p>The FDE cPP - Encryption Engine describes the requirements for the Encryption Engine piece and details the necessary security requirements and assurance activities for the actual encryption/decryption of the data by the DEK. Each cPP will also have a set of core requirements for management functions, proper handling of cryptographic keys, updates performed in a trusted manner, audit and self-tests. </h:p>
        <h:p>This TOE description defines the scope and functionality of the Authorization Acquisition, and
            the Security Problem Definition describes the assumptions made about the operating
            environment and the threats to the AA that the cPP requirements address</h:p>

        Full Drive Encryption solutions vary with implementation and vendor combinations. 
      </h:p>
      <h:p>Therefore, vendors will evaluate products that provide both components of the Full Disk
        Encryption Solution (AA and EE) against both cPPs – could be done in a single evaluation
        with one ST. A vendor that provides a single component of a FDE solution would only evaluate
        against the applicable cPP. The FDE cPP is divided into two documents to allow labs to
        independently evaluate solutions tailored to one cPP or the other. When a customer acquires
        an FDE solution, they will either obtain a single vendor product that meets the AA + EE cPPs
        or two products, one of which meets the AA and the other of which meets the EE cPPs.</h:p>

     <section title="TOE Overview" id="sec-TOEoverview">
        <h:p>
          The Target of Evaluation (TOE) for this cPP (Authorization Acquisition) may be either a Host software solution that manages a HW Encryption Engine (e.g. a SED) or as part of a combined evaluation of this cPP and the Encryption Engine cPP for a vendor that is providing a solution that includes both components.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>The following sections provide an overview of the functionality of the FDE AA as well as the security capabilities.</h:p>

     
     <section title="Authorization Acquisition Introduction" id="sec-TOEauthorization-acquisition-introduction">
      <h:p>
      The Authorization Acquisition sends a Border Encryption Value (BEV), which could be a Key Encryption Key (KEK), a Key Releasing Key (KRK), or some other type of key to the Encryption Engine. The EE does not have to use this value directly as the key to decrypt or release the DEK. It may use it as part of a scheme that uses other intermediate keys to eventually protect the DEK. A KEK wraps other keys, notably the DEK or other intermediary keys which chain to the DEK. Key Releasing Keys (KRKs) authorize the EE to release either the DEK or other intermediary keys which chain to the DEK. Figure 2 illustrates the components within AA and its relationship with EE.
    </h:p>        
      <figure entity="images/fde-authorization_acquisition.png" title="Authorization Acquisition Details" id="toe"/>    
    <h:p>
      Authorization factors may be unique to individual users or may be used by a group of individuals. In other words, the EE requires authorization factors from the AA to establish that the possessor of the authorization factor belongs to the community of users authorized to access information stored on the storage device (and does not require specific user authorization). Examples of authorization factors include, but are not limited to, passwords, passphrases, or randomly generated values stored on USB tokens or a pin to release a key on hardware storage media such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
    </h:p>
     </section>
     <section title="Authorization Acquisition Security Capabilities" id="sec-TOEauthorization-acquisition_security_capabilities">
     <h:p>
      The AA collects authorization factors which the EE uses to access data on the storage device and perform a variety of management functions. Depending on the type of authorization factor, the AA may condition them further. For example, it may apply an approved password-based key derivation function (e.g. PBKDF2) on passwords. An external token containing a randomly generated value of sufficient strength may require no further conditioning on the authorization factors. The AA may then combine one or more authorization factors in such a way that maintains the strength of both factors.
     </h:p><h:p>
     The AA serves as the main management interface to the EE. However, the EE may also offer management functionality. The requirements in the EE cPP address how the EE should handle these features. The management functionality may include the ability to send commands to the EE such as changing a DEK, setting up new users, managing KEKs and other intermediate keys, and performing a key sanitization (e.g. overwrite of the DEK). It may also forward commands that partition the drive for use by multiple users. However, this document defers the management of partitions and assumes that administrators will only provision and manage the data on whole drives.
     </h:p>
    </section>
    <section title="Interface/Boundary" id="sec-TOEInterface-Boundary">
      The interface and boundary between the AA and the EE will vary based on the implementation. If one vendor provides the entire FDE solution, then it may choose to not implement an interface between the AA and EE components. If a vendor provides a solution for one of the components, then the assumptions below state that the channel between the two components is sufficiently secure. Although standards and specifications exist for the interface between AA and EE components, the cPP does not require vendors to follow the standards in this version.
    </section>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="sec-TOEdescription">
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        <h:p>
        The environment in which the AA functions may differ depending on the boot stage of the platform in which it operates, see Figure 3. Depending on the solution’s architecture, aspects of provisioning, initialization, and authorization may be performed in the Pre-Boot environment, while encryption, decryption and management functionality are likely performed in the Operating System environment. In non-software solutions, encryption/decryption starts in Pre30 OS environment and continues into OS present environment.</h:p>
        <h:p>
          In the Operating System environment, the Authorization Acquisition has the full range of services available from the operating system (OS), including hardware drivers, cryptographic libraries, and perhaps other services external to the TOE.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>The Pre-Boot environment is much more constrained with limited capabilities. This environment turns on the minimum number of peripherals and loads only those drivers necessary to bring the platform from a cold start to executing a fully functional operating system with running applications.</h:p>
        <h:p>The AA TOE may include or leverage features and functions within the operational environment.</h:p>

      The use case for a product conforming to the FDE cPPs is to protect data at rest on a device that is lost or stolen while powered off without any prior access by an adversary. The use case where an adversary obtains a device that is in a powered state and is able to make modifications to the environment or the TOE itself (e.g., evil maid attacks) is not addressed by these cPPs (i.e., FDE-AA and FDE- EE).

      <h:p>This section provides a narrative that describes how the requirements mitigate the mapped
        threats. A requirement may mitigate aspects of multiple threats. A requirement may only mitigate a threat in a limited way. Some requirements are optional, either because the TSF fully mitigates the threat without the additional requirements being claimed or because the TSF relies on its Operational Environment to provide the functionality that is described by the optional requirements.</h:p>
      <h:p>A threat consists of a threat agent, an asset and an adverse action of that threat agent on that asset. The threat agents are the entities that put the assets at risk if an adversary obtains a lost or stolen storage device. Threats drive the functional requirements for the target of evaluation (TOE). For instance, one threat below is T.UNAUTHORIZED_DATA_ACCESS. The threat agent is the possessor (unauthorized user) of a lost or stolen storage device. The asset is the data on the storage device, while the adverse action is to attempt to obtain those data from the storage device. This threat drives the functional requirements for the storage device encryption (TOE) to authorize who can use the TOE to access the hard disk and encrypt/decrypt the data. Since possession of the KEK, DEK, intermediate keys, authorization factors, submasks, and random numbers or any other values that contribute to the creation of keys or authorization factors could allow an unauthorized user to defeat the encryption, this SPD considers key material equivalent to the data in importance and they appear among the other assets addressed below.</h:p>
      <h:p>It is important to reemphasize at this point that this collaborative Protection Profile does not expect the product (TOE) to defend against the possessor of the lost or stolen hard disk who can introduce malicious code or exploitable hardware components into the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or the Operational Environment. It assumes that the user physically protects the TOE and that the Operational Environment provides sufficient protection against logical attacks. One specific area where a conformant TOE offers some protection is in providing updates to the TOE; other than this area, though, this cPP mandates no other countermeasures. Similarly, these requirements do not address the “lost and found” hard disk problem, where an adversary may have taken the hard disk, compromised the unencrypted portions of the boot device (e.g., MBR, boot partition), and then made it available to be recovered by the original user so that they would execute the compromised code.</h:p>

		  <threat id="t-auth-guessing" name="T.AUTHORIZATION_GUESSING">
		    <description>
		      Threat agents may exercise host software to repeatedly guess authorization factors, such as passwords and PINs. Successful guessing of the authorization factors may cause the TOE to release BEV or otherwise put it in a state in which it discloses protected data to unauthorized users.

		      key material of equal importance to the data itself. Threat agents may look for key material

              the TOE accepts from the user. A password entered by the user is one authorization factor that the TOE must be able to condition, as specified in FCS_PCC_EXT.1. Another option is a smart card authorization factor, with the differentiating feature being how the value is generated – either by the TOE’s RBG or by the platform. An external USB token may also be used, with the submask value generated either by the TOE’s RBG or by the platform.</h:p>
              <h:p>The TOE may accept any number of authorization factors, and these are categorized as “submasks”. The ST author selects the authorization factors they support, and there may be multiple methods for a selection. </h:p>
              <h:p>
                Use of multiple authorization factors is preferable; if more than one authorization factor is used, the submasks produced must be combined using FCS_SMC_EXT.1 specified in Appendix A.</h:p>
              <h:p>The TOE’s use of symmetric key generation (i.e., deterministic random bit generation) and symmetric encryption determines whether the selection-based requirements FCS_CKM.1/SKG, FCS_RBG.1, and FCS_COP.1/SKC are claimed.</h:p>

This includes the random seed(s), the public exponent of the RSA key, and the desired key length. For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 key pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation by comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated from a known good implementation.</h:p> <h:p>If possible, the Random Probable primes method should also be verified against a known good implementation as described above. Otherwise, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 10 keys pairs for each supported key length nlen and verify:<h:ul><h:li>n = p⋅q,</h:li><h:li>p and q are probably prime according to Miller-Rabin tests,</h:li><h:li>GCD(p-1, e) = 1,</h:li><h:li>GCD(q-1, e) = 1,</h:li><h:li>2 <h:sup>16</h:sup>≤ e ≤ 2 <h:sup>256</h:sup> and e is an odd integer,</h:li><h:li>|p-q| > 2 <h:sup>nlen/2 - 100</h:sup>,</h:li><h:li>p ≥ 2 <h:sup>nlen/2 -1/2</h:sup>,</h:li><h:li>q ≥ 2 <h:sup>nlen/2 -1/2</h:sup>,</h:li><h:li>2 <h:sup>(nlen/2)</h:sup>&lt; d &lt; LCM(p-1, q-1),</h:li><h:li>e⋅d = 1 mod LCM(p-1, q-1).</h:li></h:ul></h:p> <h:p><h:b>Key Generation for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</h:b></h:p> <h:p><h:b>FIPS 186-5 ECC Key Generation Test</h:b>- For each supported NIST curve, i.e., P-384 and P-521, the evaluator shall require the implementation under test (IUT) to generate 10 private/public key pairs. The private key shall be generated using an approved random bit generator (RBG). To determine correctness, the evaluator shall submit the generated key pairs to the public key verification (PKV) function of a known good implementation.</h:p> <h:p><h:b>FIPS 186-5 Public Key Verification (PKV) Test</h:b>- For each supported NIST curve, i.e., P-384 and P-521, the evaluator shall generate 10 private/public key pairs using the key generation function of a known good implementation and modify five of the public key values so that they are incorrect, leaving five values unchanged (i.e., correct). The evaluator shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.</h:p> <h:p><h:b>Key Generation for Finite-Field Cryptography (FFC)</h:b></h:p> <h:p>The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the Parameters Generation and the Key Generation for FFC by the TOE using the Parameter Generation and Key Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly produce values for the field prime p, the cryptographic prime q (dividing p-1), the cryptographic group generator g, and the calculation of the private key x and public key y. The Parameter generation specifies two ways (or methods) to generate the cryptographic prime q and the field prime p:</h:p> <h:p>Cryptographic and Field Primes:<h:ul><h:li>Primes q and p shall both be provable primes</h:li><h:li>Primes q and field prime p shall both be probable primes</h:li></h:ul> and two ways to generate the cryptographic group generator g:</h:p> <h:p>Cryptographic Group Generator:<h:ul><h:li>Generator g constructed through a verifiable process</h:li><h:li>Generator g constructed through an unverifiable process.</h:li></h:ul> The Key generation specifies 2 ways to generate the private key x:</h:p> <h:p>Private Key:<h:ul><h:li>len(q) bit output of RBG where 1 ≤ x ≤ q-1</h:li><h:li>len(q) + 64 bit output of RBG, followed by a mod q-1 operation where 1≤ x ≤q-1.</h:li></h:ul> The security strength of the RBG must be at least that of the security offered by the FFC parameter set. To test the cryptographic and field prime generation method for the provable primes method and/or the group generator g for a verifiable process, the evaluator must seed the TSF parameter generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the parameter set. For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 parameter sets and key pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation by comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated from a known good implementation. Verification must also confirm <h:ul><h:li>g ≠ 0,1</h:li><h:li>q divides p-1</h:li><h:li>g <h:sup>q</h:sup> mod p = 1</h:li><h:li>g <h:sup>x</h:sup> mod p = y</h:li></h:ul> for each FFC parameter set and key pair.</h:p> <h:p><h:b>FFC Schemes using “safe-prime” groups</h:b></h:p> <h:p>The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of safe-prime groups by using a known good implementation for each protocol selected in FTP_DIT_EXT.1 that uses safe-prime groups. This test must be performed for each safe-prime group that each protocol uses.</h:p> <h:p><h:b>Key Generation for LMS/XMSS</h:b></h:p> <h:p>For each supported LMS/LMSOTS pair, the evaluator will provide 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seeds for H = 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 respectively where H = the height of the LMS tree. For each seed, the TOE will generate the corresponding public key which is to be verified by the evaluator using a known good implementation.</h:p> <h:p><h:b>Key Generation for ML-DSA</h:b></h:p> <h:p>The evaluator shall 10x input to the internal KeyGen function a 32-byte random seed. Verify the returned public-private key pair is correct using a known good implementation.

Verify the returned encapsulation and decapsulation key pair is correct using a known good implementation.

                      <h:p>There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases.
                        The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or
                        circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and
                        that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS and any other
                        relevant Required Supplementary Information. The evaluator shall check that the
                        guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may
                        be delayed at the physical layer.</h:p>
                      <h:p>For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is
                        possible that the storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection.
                        This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist
                        physically. In this case, it is assumed the drive supports the TRIM command and
                        implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively
                        engaged in other tasks. </h:p>
                      <h:p>Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such
                        there is a variable amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions.
                        There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a
                        block with other data not ready for erasure. It is assumed the operating system and file
                        system of the OE support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies
                        via garbage collection upon their deletion. </h:p>
                      <h:p>It is assumed that if a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are
                        utilized. It is assumed if the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system
                        supports TRIM over that channel. It is assumed the drive is healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and will be end of life before a significant amount of damage

                                completely relies on the underlying platform, so there is no reason to test the TOE

              <h:p>This requirement is used to verify digital signatures attached to updates from the TOE
                manufacturer before installing those updates on the TOE. Because this component is to
                be used in the update function, additional Evaluation Activities to those listed below
                are covered in other evaluation activities sections in this document. The following
                activities deal only with the implementation for the digital signature algorithm; the
                evaluator performs the testing appropriate for the algorithms selected in the
                component.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>Hash functions and/or random number generation required by these algorithms must
                be specified in the ST; therefore the Evaluation Activities associated with those
                functions are contained in the associated Cryptographic Hashing and Random Bit
                Generation sections. Additionally, the only function required by the TOE is the
                verification of digital signatures. If the TOE generates digital signatures to support the
                implementation of any functionality required by this cPP, then the applicable
                evaluation and validation scheme must be consulted to determine the required
                evaluation activities.</h:p>
              <TSS>The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure that it describes the overall flow of the
                signature verification. This should at least include identification of the format and
                general location (e.g., "firmware on the hard drive device" rather than “memory
                location 0x00007A4B") of the data to be used in verifying the digital signature; how
                the data received from the operational environment are brought on to the device; and
                any processing that is performed that is not part of the digital signature algorithm (for
                instance, checking of certificate revocation lists).</TSS>

              <Tests>
                <h:p>Each section below contains the tests the evaluators must perform for each type of
                  digital signature scheme. Based on the assignments and selections in the requirement,
                  the evaluators choose the specific activities that correspond to those selections.</h:p>
                <h:p>It should be noted that for the schemes given below, there are no key generation/domain
                  parameter generation testing requirements. This is because it is not anticipated that this
                  functionality would be needed in the end device, since the functionality is limited to
                  checking digital signatures in delivered updates. This means that the domain
                  parameters should have already been generated and encapsulated in the hard drive
                  firmware or on-board non-volatile storage. If key generation/domain parameter
                  generation is required, the evaluation and validation scheme must be consulted to
                  ensure the correct specification of the required evaluation activities and any additional
                  components.</h:p>

The messages and public key are provided to the TOE. The signature for each message is generated with the following error types "none", “modify message”, “modify signature”, “modify header”. For "none" the message is unmodified and the signature is correct. For "modify message" the signature is for a modified message where a single bit is flipped. For "modify signature", one bit of the signature is flipped. For "modify header" the signature uses a different LMS/LMSOTS pair. Each error type is represented. For each message, signature pair the TOE returns "true" or "false" depending on whether the signature verifies or not.</test>

                  Key Chaining is the method of using multiple layers of encryption keys to ultimately secure the BEV. The number of intermediate keys will vary – from one 
                  (e.g., taking the conditioned password authorization factor and directly using it as the BEV) to many. This applies to all keys that contribute to the 
                  ultimate wrapping or derivation of the BEV; including those in areas of protected storage (e.g. TPM stored keys, comparison values).<h:br/><h:br/>
                  
                  Multiple key chains to the BEV are allowed, as long as all chains meet the key chain requirement.<h:br/><h:br/>
                  
                  The BEV is considered to be equivalent to keying material and therefore additional checksums or similar values are not the BEV, even if they are sent with
                  the BEV.<h:br/><h:br/> 
                
                  Once the ST author has selected a method to create the chain (either by deriving keys or unwrapping them or encrypting keys or using RSA Key Transport), they
                  pull the appropriate requirement out of Appendix B. It is allowable for an implementation to use any or all methods.<h:br/><h:br/>
                  
                  For FCS_KYC_EXT.1.2, the validation process is defined in FCS_VAL_EXT.1, Appendix B. If that selection is made by the ST author, then FCS_VAL_EXT.1 is included
                  in the body of the ST.
                  
                  The method the TOE uses to chain keys and manage/protect them is described in the Key Management Description; see Appendix E for more information.<h:br/><h:br/>
                
                  The TOE’s use of key encryption, key encapsulation, key wrapping, key derivation, or submask combining determines whether the selection-based requirements 
                  FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc, FCS_COP.1/KeyEncap, FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, FCS_KDF_EXT.1, and FCS_SMC_EXT.1 are claimed. Additionally, the TOE’s use of key encryption or key
                  wrapping for key chaining requires FCS_CKM.1/SKG and FCS_RBG.1 (for key generation) and FCS_COP.1/SKC (for symmetric encryption) to be claimed.

            <note role="application">Key Chaining is the method of using multiple layers of encryption keys to ultimately secure the protected data encrypted on the drive. The number of intermediate keys will vary – from one (e.g., using the BEV as a key encrypting key (KEK)) to many. This applies to all keys that contribute to the ultimate wrapping or derivation of the DEK; including those in areas of protected storage (e.g. TPM stored keys, comparison values). </note>

                  The password is represented on the host machine as a sequence of characters whose encoding depends on the TOE and the 
                  underlying OS. This sequence must be conditioned into a string of bits that forms the submask to be used as input into
                  the key chain. Conditioning can be performed using one of the identified hash functions or the process described in 
                  NIST SP 800-132; the method used is selected by the ST author. If 800-132 conditioning is specified, then the ST 
                  author fills in the number of iterations that are performed. 800-132 also requires the use of a pseudo-random 
                  function (PRF) consisting of HMAC with an approved hash function. The ST author selects the hash function used which

    <h:p>This cPP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which
      the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. Individual evaluation activities to be performed are specified within
      each SFR.
  </h:p><h:p>
    <h:b>Note to ST authors: There is a selection in the ASE_TSS that must be completed. One cannot simply reference the SARs in this cPP.</h:b>
  </h:p><h:p>
    The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this cPP is as follows: after the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the TOE, supporting environmental IT (if required), and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation Activities contained within the SD, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation Activities that are captured in the SD also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the cPP.

        <aactivity>
          <h:p>
            The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
            aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
            shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
            in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in
            the <xref to="bibCEM"/> and the body of this PP’s evaluation activities.
          </h:p><h:p>
            While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
            evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
            the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those
            platforms not included in the test plan but included in the ST, the test plan provides
            a justification for not testing the platforms. This justification must address the
            differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and make an
            argument that the differences do not affect the testing to be performed. It is not
            sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no effect; rationale must be
            provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are tested, then no rationale is
            necessary. The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and
            any setup that is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It
            should be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for
            installation and setup of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard
            pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or
            tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool
            will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the TOE and its platform.
          </h:p><h:p>
            This also includes the configuration of the
            cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this
            engine are those specified by this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being
            evaluated (e.g., SSH). The test plan identifies high-level test objectives
            as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives. These
            procedures include expected results. 
          </h:p><h:p>
            The test report (which could just be an annotated
            version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test
            procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be
            a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix
            installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail”
            and “pass” result (and the supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.

  <section id="class-ava" title="Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment">
    For the current generation of this cPP, the iTC is expected to survey open sources to discover what vulnerabilities have been 
    discovered in these types of products and provide that content into the AVA_VAN discussion. In most cases, these vulnerabilities
    will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. This information will be used in the development of future Protection
    Profiles.<h:br/><h:br/>
    If the TOE is a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, the evaluator shall verify as part of the vulnerability assessment that 
    remote management services are either not present or can be fully disabled.<h:br/><h:br/>

      <h:b>Vulnerability Analysis</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b>Sources of Vulnerability Information</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
        CEM Work Unit AVA_VAN.1-3 is supplemented here to provide a better-defined set of flaws to 
        investigate and procedures to follow based on this particular technology. Terminology used is based on the flaw hypothesis
        methodology, where the evaluation team hypothesizes flaws and then either proves or disproves those flaws (a flaw is equivalent
        to a “potential vulnerability” as used in the CEM). Flaws are categorized into four “types” depending on how they are 
        formulated: <h:ol>
          <h:li>
            A list of flaw hypotheses applicable to the technology described by the cPP derived from public sources as documented in 
            the Type 1 Hypotheses section—this fixed set has been agreed to by the iTC. Additionally, this will be supplemented with entries for a set
            of public sources (as indicated below) that are directly applicable to the TOE or its identified components (as defined by 
            the process in the Type 1 Hypotheses section below); this is to ensure that the evaluators include in their assessment applicable entries 
            that have been discovered since the cPP was published;
          </h:li>
          <h:li>
            A list of flaw hypotheses contained in this document that are derived from lessons learned specific to that technology and
            other iTC input (that might be derived from other open sources and vulnerability databases, for example) as documented in 
            the Type 2 Hypotheses section;
          </h:li>
          <h:li>
            A list of flaw hypotheses derived from information available to the evaluators; this includes the baseline evidence 
            provided by the vendor described in this document (documentation associated with EAs, documentation described in
            the Vulnerability Survey section), as well as other information (public and/or based on evaluator experience) as documented in the Type 3 Hypotheses
            section; and
          </h:li>
          <h:li>
            A list of flaw hypotheses that are generated through the use of iTC-defined tools (e.g., nmap, protocol testers) and their
            application is specified in the Type 4 Hypotheses section.
          </h:li>
        </h:ol>
      <h:b><h:i>Type 1 Hypotheses-Public-Vulnerability-Based</h:i></h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
        The following list of public sources of vulnerability information was selected by the iTC:
        <h:ol type="a">
          <h:li>Search Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: http://cve.mitre.org/cve/</h:li>
          <h:li>Search the National Vulnerability Database: https://nvd.nist.gov/</h:li>
          <h:li>Search US-CERT: http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/html/search</h:li>
        </h:ol>
        The list of sources above was searched with the following search terms:
        <h:ul>
          <h:li>General (for all) <h:ul>
            <h:li>Product name</h:li>
            <h:li>Underlying components (e.g., OS, software libraries (crypto libraries), chipsets)</h:li>
            <h:li>Drive encryption, disk encryption</h:li>
            <h:li>Key destruction and sanitization</h:li>
          </h:ul></h:li>          
          <h:li>For Software FDE (AA or EE) <h:ul>
            <h:li>Key caching</h:li>
          </h:ul></h:li></h:ul>
      In order to successfully complete this activity, the evaluator will use the developer provided list of all of third party library
      information that is used as part of their product, along with the version and any other identifying information (this is required
      in the cPP as part of the ASE_TSS.1.1C requirement). This applies to hardware (including chipsets, etc.) that a vendor utilizes 
      as part of their TOE. This TOE-unique information will be used in the search terms the evaluator uses in addition to those listed
      above.<h:br/><h:br/>
      The evaluator will also consider the requirements that are chosen and the appropriate guidance that is tied to each requirement.<h:br/><h:br/>
      In order to supplement this list, the evaluators shall also perform a search on the sources listed above to determine a list of 
      potential flaw hypotheses that are more recent that the publication date of the cPP, and those that are specific to the TOE and
      its components as specified by the additional documentation mentioned above. Any duplicates – either in a specific entry, or in
      the flaw hypothesis that is generated from an entry from the same or a different source – can be noted and removed from 
      consideration by the evaluation team.<h:br/><h:br/>
      As part of type 1 flaw hypothesis generation for the specific components of the TOE, the evaluator shall also search the 
      component manufacturer’s websites to determine if flaw hypotheses can be generated on this basis (for instance, if security 
      patches have been released for the version of the component being evaluated, the subject of those patches may form the basis 
      for a flaw hypothesis).<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b><h:i>Type 2 Hypotheses-iTC-Sourced</h:i></h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
      There are no type 2 hypotheses for AA.
      <h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b><h:i>Type 3 Hypotheses-Evaluation-Team-Generated</h:i></h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
          The iTC has leveraged the expertise of the developers and the evaluation labs to diligently develop the appropriate search
          terms and vulnerability databases. They have also thoughtfully considered the iTC-sourced hypotheses the evaluators should
          use based upon the applicable use case and the threats to be mitigated by the SFRs. Therefore, it is the intent of the iTC,
          for the evaluation to focus all effort on the Type 1 and Type 2 Hypotheses and has decided that Type 3 Hypotheses are not 
          necessary.<h:br/><h:br/>
          However, if the evaluators discover a Type 3 potential flaw that they believe should be considered, they should work with 
          their Certification Body to determine the feasibility of pursuing the hypothesis. The Certification Body may determine 
          whether the potential flaw hypotheses is worth submitting to the iTC for consideration as Type 2 hypotheses in future drafts 
          of the cPP/SD.<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b><h:i>Type 4 Hypotheses-Evaluation-Team-Generated</h:i></h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
          The iTC has called out several tools that should be used during the Type 2 hypotheses process. Therefore, the use of any tools
          is covered within the Type 2 construct and the iTC does not see any additional tools that are necessary. The use case for 
          Version 2 of this cPP is rather straightforward – the device is found in a powered down state and has not been subjected to
          revisit/evil maid attacks. Since that is the use case, the iTC has also assumed there is a trusted channel between the AA and
          EE. Since the use case is so narrow, and is not a typical model for penetration or fuzzing testing, the normal types of 
          testing do not apply. Therefore, the relevant types of tools are referenced in Type 2.<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b>Process for Evaluator Vulnerability Analysis</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
          As flaw hypotheses are generated from the activities described above, the evaluation team will disposition them; that is, 
          attempt to prove, disprove, or determine the non-applicability of the hypotheses. This process is as follows.
          The evaluator will refine each flaw hypothesis for the TOE and attempt to disprove it using the information provided by the
          developer or through penetration testing. During this process, the evaluator is free to interact directly with the developer
          to determine if the flaw exists, including requests to the developer for additional evidence (e.g., detailed design 
          information, consultation with engineering staff); however, the CB should be included in these discussions. Should the
          developer object to the information being requested as being not compatible with the overall level of the evaluation 
          activity/cPP and cannot provide evidence otherwise that the flaw is disproved, the evaluator prepares an appropriate set of
          materials as follows:
          <h:ul>
            <h:li>The source documents used in formulating the hypothesis, and why it represents a potential compromise against a 
              specific TOE function;</h:li>
            <h:li>An argument why the flaw hypothesis could not be proven or disproved by the evidence provided so far; and</h:li>
            <h:li>The type of information required to investigate the flaw hypothesis further.</h:li>
          </h:ul>
          The Certification Body (CB) will then either approve or disapprove the request for additional information. If approved, the
          developer provides the requested evidence to disprove the flaw hypothesis (or, of course, acknowledge the flaw).<h:br/><h:br/>
          For each hypothesis, the evaluator will note whether the flaw hypothesis has been successfully disproved, successfully proven
          to have identified a flaw, or requires further investigation. It is important to have the results documented as outlined in 
          the Reporting section below.
          If the evaluator finds a flaw, the evaluator must report these flaws to the developer. All reported flaws must be addressed 
          as follows:<h:br/><h:br/>
          If the developer confirms that the flaw exists and that it is exploitable at Basic Attack Potential, then a change is made by
          the developer, and the resulting resolution is agreed by the evaluator and noted as part of the evaluation report.<h:br/><h:br/>
          If the developer, the evaluator, and the CB agree that the flaw is exploitable only above Basic Attack Potential and does not 
          require resolution for any other reason, then no change is made and the flaw is noted as a residual vulnerability in the 
          CB-internal report (ETR).<h:br/><h:br/>
          If the developer and evaluator agree that the flaw is exploitable only above Basic Attack Potential, but it is deemed critical
          to fix because of technology-specific or cPP-specific aspects such as typical use cases or operational environments, then a 
          change is made by the developer, and the resulting resolution is agreed by the evaluator and noted as part of the evaluation
          report.<h:br/><h:br/>
          Disagreements between evaluator and vendor regarding questions of the existence of a flaw, its attack potential, or whether
          it should be deemed critical to fix are resolved by the CB.<h:br/><h:br/>
          Any testing performed by the evaluator shall be documented in the test report as outlined
          in the Reporting section below.<h:br/><h:br/>
          As indicated in the Reporting section, the public statement with respect to vulnerability analysis that is performed on TOEs 
          conformant to the cPP is constrained to coverage of flaws associated with Types 1 and 2 (defined in the Sources of 
          Vulnerability Information section) flaw hypotheses only. The fact that the iTC generates these candidate hypotheses indicates 
          these must be addressed.<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b>Reporting</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
          The evaluators shall produce two reports on the testing effort; one that is public-facing (that is, included in the 
          non-proprietary evaluation report, which is a subset of the Evaluation Technical Report (ETR)), and the complete ETR that is 
          delivered to the overseeing CB.<h:br/><h:br/>
          The public-facing report contains:<h:ul>
          <h:li>The flaw identifiers returned when the procedures for searching public sources were followed according to instructions in
            the Type 1 Hypotheses section;</h:li>
            <h:li>A statement that the evaluators have examined the Type 1 flaw hypotheses specified
              in this document in the 
              Type 1 Hypotheses section (i.e. the flaws listed in the previous bullet) and the Type 2 flaw hypotheses specified in the 
              the Type 2 Hypotheses section</h:li>
          </h:ul>
          No other information is provided in the public-facing report.<h:br/><h:br/>
          The internal CB report contains, in addition to the information in the public-facing report:<h:ul>
            <h:li>a list of all of the flaw hypotheses generated (cf. AVA_VAN.1-4);</h:li>
            <h:li>the evaluator penetration testing effort, outlining the testing approach, configuration, depth and results (cf. 
              AVA_VAN.1-9);</h:li>
            <h:li>all documentation used to generate the flaw hypotheses (in identifying the documentation used in coming up with the
              flaw hypotheses, the evaluation team must characterize the documentation so that a reader can determine whether it is 
              strictly required in this document, and the nature of the documentation (design information, developer 
              engineering notebooks, etc.));</h:li>
            <h:li>the evaluator shall report all exploitable vulnerabilities and residual vulnerabilities, detailing for each:
              <h:ol type="a">
              <h:li>its source (e.g. CEM activity being undertaken when it was conceived, known to the evaluator, read in a publication)</h:li>

              <h:li>a description;</h:li>
              <h:li>whether it is exploitable in its operational environment or not (i.e. exploitable or residual).</h:li>
              <h:li>the amount of time, level of expertise, level of knowledge of the TOE, level of opportunity and the equipment 
                required to perform the identified vulnerabilities (cf. AVA_VAN.1-11);</h:li>
              <h:li>how each flaw hypothesis was resolved (this includes whether the original flaw hypothesis was confirmed or 
                disproved, and any analysis relating to whether a residual vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with Basic
                Attack Potential) (cf. AVA_VAN1-10); and</h:li>
              <h:li>in the case that actual testing was performed in the investigation (either as part of flaw hypothesis generation

                setting up the TOE (and any required test equipment); executing the test; post-test procedures; and the actual results
                (to a level of detail that allow repetition of the test, including the following:<h:ul>
              <h:li>identification of the potential vulnerability the TOE is being tested for;</h:li>
              <h:li>instructions to connect and setup all required test equipment as required to conduct the penetration test;</h:li>

The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.</h:p>
      <h:p>This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.</h:p>
      <h:p>If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included.</h:p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec-ent-justification" title="Entropy Justification">
      <h:p>There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by this particular TOE). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy.</h:p>
      <h:p>The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the product.</h:p>
      <h:p>For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of min-entropy in each output. </h:p>
      <h:p>For third party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular, the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST.</h:p>
      <h:p>Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.</h:p>
      <h:p>The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.</h:p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec-ent-oc" title="Operating Conditions">The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is no longer guaranteed to provide sufficient entropy. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included.</section>
    <section id="s-ent-health" title="Health Testing">More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, TOE behavior upon entropy source failure, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.</section>

<appendix id="apndx-keyMan" title="Key Management Description">
  <h:p>The documentation of the product’s encryption key management should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the product’s key management and how it meets the requirements to ensure the keys are adequately protected. This documentation should include an essay and diagrams. This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS - it can be submitted as a separate document and marked as developer proprietary.</h:p>
  <h:p>Essay:</h:p>
  <h:p>The essay will provide the following information for all keys in the key chain:</h:p>
  <h:p><h:ul>
    <h:li>The purpose of the key</h:li>
    <h:li>If the key is stored in non-volatile memory</h:li>
    <h:li>How and when the key is protected</h:li>
    <h:li>How and when the key is derived</h:li>
    <h:li>The strength of the key</h:li>
    <h:li>When or if the key would be no longer needed, along with a justification.</h:li>
  </h:ul>The essay will also describe the following topics:</h:p>
  <h:p><h:ul>
    <h:li>A description of all authorization factors that are supported by the product and how each factor is handled, including any conditioning and combining performed.</h:li>
    <h:li>If validation is supported, the process for validation shall be described, noting what value is used for validation and the process used to perform the validation. It shall describe how this process ensures no keys in the key chain are weakened or exposed by this process.</h:li>
    <h:li>The authorization process that leads to the ultimate release of the BEV. This section shall detail the key chain used by the product. It shall describe which keys are used in the protection of the BEV and how they meet the derivation, key wrap, or a combination of the two requirements, including the direct chain from the initial authorization to the BEV. It shall also include any values that add into that key chain or interact with the key chain and the protections that ensure those values do not weaken or expose the overall strength of the key chain.</h:li>
    <h:li>The diagram and essay will clearly illustrate the key hierarchy to ensure that at no point the chain could be broken without a cryptographic exhaust or all of the initial authorization values and the effective strength of the BEV is maintained throughout the Key Chain. 
      </h:li>
    <h:li>A description of the data encryption engine, its components, and details about its implementation (e.g. for hardware: integrated within the device’s main SOC or separate co-processor, for software: initialization of the product, drivers, libraries (if applicable), logical interfaces for encryption/decryption, and areas which are not encrypted (e.g. boot loaders, portions associated with the Master Boot Record (MBRs), partition tables, etc.)). The description should also include the data flow from the device’s host interface to the device’s persistent media storing the data, information on those conditions in which the data bypasses the data encryption engine (e.g. read-write operations to an unencrypted Master Boot Record area). The description should be detailed enough to verify all platforms to ensure that when the user enables encryption, the product encrypts all hard storage devices. It should also describe the platform’s boot initialization, the encryption initialization process, and at what moment the product enables the encryption.</h:li>
    <h:li>The process for destroying keys when they are no longer needed by describing the storage location of all keys and the protection of all keys stored in non-volatile memory.</h:li>

  </h:ul></h:p>
  <h:p>Diagram:
  </h:p>
  <h:p>
    <h:ul>
      <h:li>The diagram will include all keys from the initial authorization factors to the BEV and any keys or values that contribute into the chain. It must list the cryptographic strength of each key and indicate how each key along the chain is protected with either Key Derivation or Key Wrapping (from the allowed options). The diagram should indicate the input used to derive or unwrap each key in the chain.</h:li>
      <h:li>A functional (block) diagram showing the main components (such as memories and processors) and the data path between, for hardware, the device’s host interface and the device’s persistent media storing the data, or for software, the initial steps needed for the activities the TOE performs to ensure it encrypts the storage device entirely when a user or administrator first provisions the product. The hardware encryption diagram shall show the location of the data encryption engine within the data path.</h:li>
      <h:li>The hardware encryption diagram shall show the location of the data encryption engine within the data path. The evaluator shall validate that the hardware encryption diagram contains enough detail showing the main components within the data path and that it clearly identifies the data encryption engine. </h:li>
    </h:ul>
